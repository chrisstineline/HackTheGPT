**Introduction: I like polyrhythms (Ref 1), and ChatGPT likes Polymorphism.** 

I'll be using Polymorphism as a reference because of the multi-layer aspect to it of: 

Flexibility -> Code can be written ambiguously and thereby multipurpose and able handle a variety of objects, without needing to know specifics to compile

Code reusability -> The ambiguous generic code operates on a base class, working with any derived classes 

Abstraction -> Allowing for not having specific details of different objects = common behavior is allowed


### Model 5 and results
Using Model 5 affects the results given when prompting for new entries -> The model will provided a better structure, seemingly finding targets which are high risk, and is overall being selective regarding data.
Reusing prompts and results by only prompting "new list" also keeps the model on track, and continuously producing the same level of data. This inherited
